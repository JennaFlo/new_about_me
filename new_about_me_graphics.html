  <h2>Graphic Design Projects</h2>
  <p>The following are links to websites that are part of my design portfolio
  and are currently live. They were developed using thea combination of the video
  footage and photography I captured at the respective events. All of the sounds,
  images, and editing(including graphics) were taken and designed by me.
  <a href="http://www.stunt-stl.com/">Stunt.StL</a></p>

  <h2>Social media pages</h2>
  <p>A huge part of my design portfolio includes maintaining social media sites
  for myself and other artists. Here are links to my main facebook pages, including
  my stunt.stl page, stunt.stl boardsports, and jflo designs.
  <!--insert links to fb page here-->
  Additional, I have an maintain 2 instagram accounts where I host photos, connect
  with other athletes, and sell my merchandise for my brands.</p>

  <h2>Photography</h2>
  <p>In addition to graphic work, I enjoy taking photos at a number of different
  venues. I've developed my Stunt.StL brand as my sports photography website,
and have created a second source of photography as JFlo Photography for my art
and event photography.</p>

  <h2>Apparel</h2>
  <p>In addition to photogtaphy under the Stunt.StL name, I have developed a following
  with the t-shirt designs I have completed for the Stunt.StL brand. These shirts
are seen work in a number of motorcyle and long-boarding events, and have worked
personally with a number of professional athletes to make individual shirts for
their brands and companies. </p>
